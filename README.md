# React Gesture Carousel

A simple experiment making a swipable, gesture based 360 carousel in react. 
It will eventually be rewritten as an exercise is applying hooks.


TODOs
===
- Refactor using hooks
- Add images or a subject that more noticabley rotates (360 degrees worth of images of my head maybe) 
- Implement animations, likely through react-spring

TODones 👍
===
